<h1>The odin project - first project - Google Homepage!</h1>

<p>My first ever project via "The Odin Project". Which is to create a page similar to Google's homepage. This is to demonstrate basic skills I have learned so far and what skills I feel I have used to make the project</p>

<p>It's a chance to get more comfortable using the inspector tool via Google chrome.</p>
